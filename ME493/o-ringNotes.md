##notes on O-ring design

* There's a lot of existing documentation of o-ring design.
* okay for a wide range of temperatures
* usually okay below 3000 rpm on a 2" shaft
* Buna-N (nitrile) is the most common
* okay for common engineering (non-chem) applications
* There are whole tables/manuals for operating temps, chemical compatibility, flame resistance, et cetera.
* standardized by: AS 568 and ISO 3601
* [online dimension search applications](http://www.applerubber.com/oring-size-search/) are available (makes it easy to find what you need).
* rings should be squeezed about 10% to 40%
* should generally not stretch more than 5% on ID
* should fill the gland between 75% and 90%
* the draft angle(ish) of the groove should be ~5deg
* there are also calculators available for determining the appropriate o-ring/groove choices

* there're also u-cup seals, which expand out to form the seal as the pressure increases. (one way)
* Gough-Joule effect
	* when an elastomer is stretched and then heated, it contracts. This must be taken into account for high operating temperatures.
* Lip seals
	* work well at high speed and low pressure
	* often used as a dust/moisture barrier
	* may be oriented to retain a lubricant or exclude a contaminant.
	* You can put two back-to-back with a buffer grease to do both.
* v-lip, flexi-lip for grease and high speed
* if you need high temperatures, you have to go for metal rings. These are very expensive, since they need to be very precise.
* For high speed/temp, you need labyrinth seals. 
	* These simply give the fluid a very contorted path to follow. 
	* These are used in jet engines. 
	* These are very expensive.
* Mechanical seals.
	* Just riddiculously well matched/polished surfaces.
